== Overview

The presentations corresponding to the different talks given in the frame of the lotus-initiative.

Each talk corresponds to a subfolder.

To create a new one, simply start from an older one and everything should build easily, thanks to https://github.com/bjonnh[bjonnh] !

== Generation of the presentations

Again, the whole process is explained in the https://github.com/Ardemius/asciidoctor-presentation#slides-rendering-with-revealjs[main doc of the repo]. +
But, as a reminder, here is just the final command:

[source,asciidoctor]
----
bash build.sh
----

== Generation of the pages

If you want your presentation to be indexed on the https://lotus.nprod.net/lotus-presentations/[following page], then just create an additional `yourPresentation.md` file corresponding to `yourSubfolder/` where your index.html is located 

Then fill it accordingly:

[source,asciidoctor]
----
---
title: yourPresentation
layout: template
filename: yourSubfolder/index.html
--- 
----
